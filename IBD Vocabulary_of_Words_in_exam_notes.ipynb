        "2. **Annotate Data**: Annotate the collected medical corpus with the entities you want to recognize, such as medical terms or specific medical concepts. You can use annotation tools like Prodigy, Brat, or even manually annotate the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Convert Annotations to MedSpaCy Format**: Convert the annotated data into MedSpaCy format, which typically involves converting the annotations to the Doc and Span objects of MedSpaCy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Train MedSpaCy**: Use the converted annotated data to train a MedSpaCy model. This involves initializing a blank MedSpaCy model, loading the converted data, and running multiple training iterations to update the model's entity recognition capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Evaluate and Fine-tune**: After training, evaluate the performance of the trained model on a held-out dataset. If necessary, fine-tune the model by iterating over the training and evaluation process until satisfactory performance is achieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Test and Use**: Once the model is trained and performs well, you can use it to recognize medical terms in new text data."
